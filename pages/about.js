      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        In 2003, I graduated from Lviv National Academy of Arts with a Master's
        degree and was actively involved in art until 2019. During that time, I
        created both commercial and artistic pieces, utilizing stained glass and
        wrought iron techniques. In the commercial sector, I earned a lot of
        income by creating stained glass pieces in classic and Tiffany styles,
        such as stained glass lamps, ceilings, souvenirs, tables, and
        chandeliers. I also worked with wrought iron to create metal banisters,
        staircases, balconies, exclusive beds, wrought iron lamps with stained
        glass, and various interior and exterior design elements. Since I have a
        well-developed sense of three-dimensional thinking, I created sculptures
        of various sizes, from small souvenirs to large art pieces.

        In addition to sculpture, I also created three-dimensional art objects
        from various materials, but I always used glass and lighting to add
        magic to my works. Besides glass and light, I also incorporated metals
        such as wrought iron, bronze, aluminum, and copper, as well as wood and
        leather into my art pieces, which resembled illuminated sculptures. I
        participated in various exhibitions, including international ones.

        With the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and isolation, I started
        learning front-end development.
